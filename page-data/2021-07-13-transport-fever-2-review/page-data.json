A spiritual successor of (open)TTD it scratches that itch perfectly, even adding some new features such as a first person camera.</strong></p>\n<p>Graphics aren’t spectaculair or anything, but they still look really nice even when you are all the way zoomed in or in the first-person view. The goal of the game is to build transport in between everything. There are really two sides: cargo and passengers. I played through the campaign, which has three chapters with 6 missions each. In total it cost me 60 hours to complete the campaign, including all bonus missions. During this time I did encounter quite a few tasks which weren’t clearly explained.</p>\n<p>For example you need to gather some plant that only grows above a certain altitude and you’re given only a location. What do you do? Turns out you need to demolish the plant that stand in between 2 height lines which isn’t told to you. There are many other tasks that are like this, not at all clear or too vague to do anything with. But the rest of the campaign was amazingly fun and really shows off the different time periods and transportation ways.</p>\n<p>Audio is also really good, after 60 playhours I didn’t get tired of it, the only thing to note is that in the campaign the music player is broke (maybe because it plays specific music that fits with the current mission?). Played this with Geforce Now and the performance was great.</p>\n<p>Beside the story there is also a free mode which allows infinite playablity with random maps so even after finishing the campaign there should be more than enough to do making the price absolutly worth it especially since it is still getting updates (the summer update dropped at the end of my campaign, which improved a lot of things).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transport Fever 2 Review","date":"July 13, 2021","description":"Going back in time"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-13-transport-fever-2-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-12-horizon-zero-dawn-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Horizon Zero Dawn Review"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
