A great story and okay gameplay keep you on your toes because you never know what you will discover around the next corner.</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics, especially the ray-tracing look really great on Geforce Now and don’t seem to impact the FPS too much, staying always above 30 FPS (that I’ve noticed). Beautiful graphics. The gameplay on the other hand is a bit less, especially it not having explicit difficulty modes but several sliders to change yourself. Now technically this might be much better since the user can experiment themselves what feels right. I didn’t want to check what what slider did, so it would’ve been great if they just had a few templates that you can use without having to change all the different sliders and such. Rest of the gameplay kinda fun but without going into spoilers.</p>\n<p>The music is okay, I can’t really remember the soundtrack except the two times that a song is explicitly used in the plot. Coming back to the gameplay, the difficulty was okay, I felt like when I died that was because I sucked not because the game was too hard.</p>\n<p>Control is set in a single office building, but it feels more than big enough for the entirety of the game. The story itself is I must say not what I expected, though I hadn’t seen anytihng about it except the title (and that it was good). It took me close to 12 hours to finish the main story with plently of side quests left undone, so the price might be a bit high if you only play once through the main story. I did not encounter a single bug (that I can remember) during my time with Control, which was pretty nice.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Control Ultimate Edition Review","date":"July 03, 2021","description":"Reviewing the federal bureau of control"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-03-control-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-02-fallout-new-vegas-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fallout New Vegas Review"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
