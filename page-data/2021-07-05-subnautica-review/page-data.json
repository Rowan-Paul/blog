At the endgame I got bored so I didn’t finish the game, but I did play for 17 hours in total so here’s my review of that.</strong></p>\n<p>Under the water the world of Subnautica looks really great, even on low settings. But here we come to our first problem: sometimes textures don’t load in which you don’t notice because you’ve never seen this structure and are thus stuck until a reload. Not really fun.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is pretty good, although near the end of the middle it gets a bit grindy. At a certain point you are meant to have certain vehicles and resources setup, but you can bascially ignore all of those because it’s not explicitly layed out for you. It would be nice if there was more a sort of roadmap for you to follow (I mean there might be one in the wiki or something, but I didn’t really Google because I was afraid of spoilers). The music in the game is really calming and helps with the immersion.</p>\n<p>It definitely needs at least a decent pc, but my laptop was able to run it and without a GPU at decent framerates. The game isn’t really that difficult, dying lets you respawn with only a few (?) items from your inventory missing unless you play on hardcore mode that is.</p>\n<p>The story of the game helps with making you progress, but it’s not always there and you could just ignore it and build your own underwater paradise. The logs and other things you can find really help with connecting you with the story. Like I said I didn’t finish the game because I got distracted by another, but there is definetly enough to keep you busy under the sea. That also makes the 30€ that it cost kind of worth it, though it could use some more polish.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Subnautica Review","date":"July 05, 2021","description":"Going under water with this review"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-05-subnautica-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-04-anno-2205-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Anno 2205 Reviews"}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
