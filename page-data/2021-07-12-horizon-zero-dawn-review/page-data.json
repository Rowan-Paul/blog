The characters feel real and the world evolves together with the story. Recommended.</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics for Horizon Zero Dawn look quite nice although the game is quite heavy, I was not able to get a 3o FPS on my potato. In the main menu it says “Optimising shaders” every time you load it because it removes the optimised shaders every time you load the game (if you let it load fully it will take around half an hour, so don’t). But even on everything on low it still looked pretty good. If it had, for example, Geforce Now support or some optimisations I would definitely have played it some more than the 16 hours I have played until now.</p>\n<p>Gameplay mostly manages to keep away from the (often) repeating get quest do thing to get information or thing. Or as I should say: you don’t feel like it is happpening which is always great. You can after a story moment change the dino’s to help you, which is a pretty cool mechanic.</p>\n<p>The audio is really nice, the dino’s sound realistic and the background music, although not quite memorable, still good enough not to want to turn it off during my playthrough. It’s not that difficult to play once you get a handle on where to shoot the different dinosaurs. I absolutely loved the story and am rally looking forward to the sequel (hoping they’ll release it on PC not too long after the PS release). Like I said before, the characters feel real and one with the world.</p>\n<p>My playthrough of the main story took me 16 hours, so it’s about average length but there are many many more side quests that will give you lots more things to do in between the main quests. If you have a good enough PC and like RPGs you should definetly get it for the 29,99€ on-sale price.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Horizon Zero Dawn Review","date":"July 12, 2021","description":"Post apocalyptic dino RPF"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-12-horizon-zero-dawn-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-05-subnautica-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Subnautica Review"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-13-transport-fever-2-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Transport Fever 2 Review"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
