The game is the shortest in the triology, but that is partly because of the big feature in the game: after the first act or so the story splits in two and you need to choose a side. Much beter than the first game, but still has some much needed polish missing. I finished the game on March 6th but only now got around to reviewing it.</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics are good, they holds up pretty well. You can tell graphics were a priority for CDPR as all games in the series look pretty good even after all this time.</p>\n<p>Gameplay has become good, showing the first itteration of The Witcher 3 systems. Audio is also good I’d say, I don’t remember any songs but I never switched to listening to my own music during the duration of the game (the game is also pretty short so that helps of course). The audience firmly remains adults. The game needs a decent PC to run and performed good on Nvidia Geforce Now.</p>\n<p>As with all Witcher games, the game has some really difficult bosses that need specific techniques to beat them. As soon as you have Googled these techniques, the fight becomes easier. The grind isn’t really there as I focused on the main quest and was pretty on-level for most fights during the game.</p>\n<p>The story is a bit weaker with the main antogonist ending up {spoiler}, but it’s still a lovely story that shows a real-feeling world that makes me excited to replay The Witcher 3. As said in the intro, I took 20 hours to complete the main game with a few side quests sprinkled in, so the game time is about average.</p>\n<p>Together with the other Witcher games this game is definitly worth the price, though I’d advice playing The Witcher 3 to see if these games are anything for you.</p>\n<p>The bugs can get a bit annoying over time, but nothing really game breaking.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The Witcher 2 Review","date":"April 11, 2021","description":"A review of The Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-11-the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-11-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The Witcher 3 Review"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-01-oneplus-bullets-z/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Review"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
