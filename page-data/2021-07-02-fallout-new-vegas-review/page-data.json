For this review I followed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaFN2nAkGh0&#x26;list=PLyh1OWxYFlNKqxYm42dPi9Q9YsYU6edLg\">this tutorial</a> on how to mod New Vegas. If you like RPGs and don’t mind walking around, give New Vegas a go.</strong></p>\n<p>The graphics of New Vegas have definitely aged, but are still pretty good. Especially the world around you still looks pretty good, being helped by the fact that I could play maxed out settings of course. I haven’t seen everyting because I mostly sticked to the main story for my first playthrough (which took 23 hours) but most of the gameplay is the classic find a settlement, help the people (or murder them), get rich and onto the next town. The VATs is an interesting idea, but I didn’t really use it that often.</p>\n<p>The soundtrack is kind of hidden, there are different radio stations that you can enable on your pip boy but the game doesn’t tell you this. Once you do find the radio stations, you probably wanna keep them on since they’re great and really fit the world well.</p>\n<p>I was able to run the game on my potato pretty well and that’s no surprise seeing the age of the game, so you too should be fine. The difficulty isn’t all that high once you get a hold of the different weapons and when to use them. One point that you should always keep stocked are stimpacks since you can go into a mission and keep dying because of low health (making it really difficult unless you roll back and get some before starting the mission again).</p>\n<p>The main story is a choose your own faction (or make your own) and it’s pretty cool how settlements react to you helping them or not, making it a ralistic world. Main story was pretty good though although at times it does fall into that do this thing for x so you can do this thing for y. The world is massive and they’re enough side quests at all times that I imagine you’d always have something to do.</p>\n<p>As said in the intro, I had to install some mods that made it run better on a modern computer and fixed a whole lot of bugs. The base game itself would get a D on the bugs but with the fixes from the community I think it only caused me 1 BSOD in my playthrough (which is one too many of course). Looking at the mods available, New Vegas is definitely worth the price since you can turn it into so many different things though the base game (with some fixes) is also really great.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Fallout New Vegas Review","date":"July 02, 2021","description":"Reviewing the 2010 Fallout spin-off"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-02-fallout-new-vegas-review/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-01-setup-nginx-pm2 -react-node/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to setup nginx and pm2 for React & node"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-03-control-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Control Ultimate Edition Review"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
