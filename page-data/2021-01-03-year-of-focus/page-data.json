This year I’ve decided to join them, since I finally have a good theme in mind for this year.</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s get one thing clear: what is a yearly theme? Well it’s quite simple:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The idea of Yearly Themes is something that CGP Grey and Myke Hurley have been living by for a number of years. Instead of resolutions, we set an overall idea of how we would like to approach each year or season. This becomes almost like a guiding principle for our work and/or personal lives for that period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you wanna know more about yearly themes, check the <a href=\"https://www.thethemesystem.com/\">theme system journal site</a>.</p>\n<p>Not being big on sporting, I haven’t had something I’d want to call my yearly theme. But today I thought about something I’ve been thinking a lot about these past few years: how I spent my time. When I have vacation I always do 3 things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>watch TV shows/movies/YouTube</li>\n<li>play games</li>\n<li>sleep a lot</li>\n<li>work on side projects</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of those are pretty valid things to do during vacation, because that’s what that is for. But I always get the feeling when I’ve done one of those things that I “wasted” my time doing that while I should’ve been doing one of the other things. Finding a balance is quite hard for me, even though it doesn’t actually matter at all (except for my brain).</p>\n<p>That’s why this year is going to be the year of focus: a year to stop with worrying about wasting my time doing any one of those things. Basically, if I’m going to be gaming all day I’m not gonna be upset I didn’t finish my Lord of the Rings marathon. I’ll probably keep you guys up-to-date here how it is going.</p>\n<p>And another little tidbit: I’ve started doing push-ups 4 weeks ago and I’m on 60 already!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Year of Focus","date":"January 03, 2021","description":"A Cortex year theme."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-01-03-year-of-focus/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2020-12-30-cyberpunk-2077/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Cyberpunk 2077 Review"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2021-01-03-rimworld-review/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Rimworld Review"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1995925640","2841359383"]}
