**Very much a continuation of Planet Coaster, which I liked quite a bit. Been playing the Career parks and having a blast so far. Animals look pretty good, but still has quite some time before it reaches that Zoo Tycoon 2 level**

---{Price}---

☑ Minor bugs
☐ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

_Sometimes your staff doesn't know where to go and animals can glitch out a bit_
