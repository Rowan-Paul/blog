This is a review of my second playthrough of The Witcher 3, with my first playthrough of the DLC. In total I've played 183 hours of this game, 141 hours of which in this playthrough. This game is so massive, I can only scratch the surface here but I'll try to keep it the same length as the other games.

**This game is the best game I've played since Cyberpunk. Both are amazing singleplayer story games with so many choices and outcomes. I absolutely love this game so much. This is my second playthrough so I played through every quest I got in my quest screen, this took me around 141 hours in total (including the 2 DLC).**

Currently The Witcher 3 is being remastered into 4K with Raytracing, but the game already makes you forget what reality is. While traveling on Roach (they finally included her) just look around and be amazed at the beautiful scenery. That leads nicely into the very good gameplay. You have 2 main ways to get around: quick travel points that you have to discover sprinkled throughout the world and manually walking/riding/boating/swimming around.

You get quests by picking them up from notice boards, getting them through the main story or by walking into them. Pay attention to NPCs screaming at you with a exclamation point next to their name, these have quest for you.Yes, I did finish the whole GWENT part of the game, just as the fistfighting (which isn't such a great system) and the horse races in each area of the game (both of which are pretty easy to win once you get how to play them). If you don't know, GWENT is a kind of card game inside the Witcher universe which requires you to collect cards by playing NPCs and doing tournaments.

The audio is very good, I can still hear the GWENT theme inside my head playing. During the game I did switch to listening to my own music, but that was more because of the length of the game and I always returned quickly to the game music. The game has pretty explicit scenes and a lot of violence, so naturally the game is for adults only.

If you want to run the game at high (which I would recommend since it looks great), you need a pretty fast pc. For my first playthrough I played on my own potato pc and it was playable, although my pc did get pretty hot. My second playthrough I did on Nvidia Geforce Now on high and it handled it pretty well.

Just like the previous two games, this game has some pretty difficult boss fights by design that need specific techniques to beat them. And just like the previous games it gets easier once you get an idea of the different counter moves you have to do in order to beat this specific boss. The grind is just like the other games, you can do all the sidequest and have a much easier time or just play through the main quest and be a bit underleveld.

Now the story is absolutely amazing, for both the main game, the two DLCs and the other quests. I won't spoil anything here, but please play Blood and Wine if you enjoyed the main game since it has a really nice ending to Geralt's story (I haven't even spoken about Geraly, but hey these are short reviews!). After finishing the game I want to read the books and replay the other games again.

The game is easily more than a hundred hours long, during my first playthrough doing a few sidequests and no DLCs I finished in 43 hours. Having done a close-to-100%-playthrough this time, I finished after 141 hours. With this amount of content, the game is basically free for the on-sale price. That's why I recommend you buy and play The Witcher 3 first so you know if these are for you.

There are some minor bugs, but the only one I can remember right now is that sometimes Roach walks up against an invisible wall and you can't move past that point. This seems to be a problem with bridges or something, but it only happens every so often.

If you need a longer, super in depth review of The Witcher games I recommend the Witcher reviews from [Joseph Anderson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ) (waiting patiently on his Witcher 3 video).
