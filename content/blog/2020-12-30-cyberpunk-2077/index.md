**Having finished two playthroughs of this using Nvidia Geforce Now to play. I've had a great time playing and still not done with it. The stories are just amazing and suck you in. Bugs are there, but mostly just visual. Recommended, can't wait what else they do with this game and Judy is the best**

## Graphics

☑ You forget what reality is
☐ Beautiful
☐ Good
☐ Decent
☐ Bad
☐ Don‘t look too long at it
☐ MS-DOS

_This game looks amazing, even without Ray Tracing. Truly next-gen (see: all the screenshots I took)_

## Gameplay

☐ Very good
☐ Good
☑ It‘s just gameplay
☐ Mehh
☐ Watch paint dry instead
☐ Just don't

_Driving kinda broke, use a motorcycle_

☐ Very good
☐ Good
☐ Not too bad
☐ Bad

## Audience

☐ Kids
☐ Teens
☑ Adults
☐ All

## PC Requirements

☐ Check if you can run paint
☐ Potato
☐ Decent
☐ Fast
☐ Rich boi
☑ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer

_Using Nvidia Geforce Now, I get around 40-60 fps on Ultra, raytracing takes about another 10 off of there_

## Difficulity

☐ Just press 'W'
☐ Easy
☐ Significant brain usage
☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master
☐ Difficult
☐ Dark Souls

## Grind

☐ Nothing to grind
☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
☑ Isn't necessary to progress
☐ Average grind level
☐ Too much grind
☐ You‘ll need a second live for grinding

## Story

☐ No Story
☐ Some lore
☐ Average
☐ Good
☐ Lovely
☑ It‘ll replace your life

_Main story pretty good, sidequests are even better_

## Game Time

☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee
☐ Short
☐ Average
☑ Long
☐ To infinity and beyond

_First playthrough took me 38 hours, second took me 36_

## Price

☐ It’s free!
☑ Worth the price
☐ If u have some spare money left
☐ Not recommended
☐ You could also just burn your money

## Bugs

☐ Never heard of
☐ Minor bugs
☑ Can get annoying
☐ ARK: Survival Evolved
☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

_The game has bugs, but most are just visual glitches. Also driving kinda sucks_
