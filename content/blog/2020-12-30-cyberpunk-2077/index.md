**Having finished two playthroughs of this using Nvidia Geforce Now to play. I've had a great time playing and still not done with it. The stories are just amazing and suck you in. Bugs are there, but mostly just visual. Recommended, can't wait what else they do with this game and Judy is the best**

## Graphics

- [x] **You forget what reality is**
- [ ] Beautiful
- [ ] Good

## Difficulity

- [ ] Just press 'W'
- [ ] Easy
- [ ] Significant brain usage
- [x] **Easy to learn / Hard to master**
- [ ] Difficult
- [ ] Dark Souls

## Grind

- [ ] Nothing to grind
- [ ] Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks
- [x] **Isn't necessary to progress**
- [ ] Average grind level
- [ ] Too much grind
- [ ] You‘ll need a second live for grinding

## Story

- [ ] No Story
- [ ] Some lore
- [ ] Average
- [ ] Good
- [ ] Lovely
- [x] **It‘ll replace your life**

_Main story pretty good, sidequests are even better_

## Game Time

- [ ] Long enough for a cup of coffee
- [ ] Short
- [ ] Average
- [x] **Long**
- [ ] To infinity and beyond

_First playthrough took me 38 hours, second took me 36_

## Price

- [ ] It’s free!
- [x] **Worth the price**
- [ ] If u have some spare money left
- [ ] Not recommended
- [ ] You could also just burn your money

## Bugs

- [ ] Never heard of
- [ ] Minor bugs
- [x] **Can get annoying**
- [ ] ARK: Survival Evolved
- [ ] The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs

_The game has bugs, but most are just visual glitches. Also driving kinda sucks_
