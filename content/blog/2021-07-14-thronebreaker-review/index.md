**A fun point and click adventure that also has a great card game inside of it. A great story like all Witcher games.**

Thronebreaker has the same style as the animated bits of the Witcher 3, meaning it looks really great and captures the world really well. The game switches between a point-and-click style adventure where you wander around the map and a card game where you have to beat your enemy with the deck you have build up during the game. The battles stay interesting because each one has a special gimmick and the game uses the different decks throughout the game very well.

The audio is, like with all CDPR games, really good and the system requirements aren't that high, running great on Geforce Now. The card games can definitely get hard, but if you are on low difficulty you can skip card games if you lose so you don't become stuck.

Story of the entire game is really great and shows once again that well developed characters are really important. It even has a little cross over with books (as in literally a scene from the books) that was handled quite well. The whole game took me around 12 hours to finish, but I did play on easy so you should expect closer to 30 if you go with a higher difficulty.
