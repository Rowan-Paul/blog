**While I had a lot of fun with Anno 2205, the game could use some more pointers at specific moments. It was my first Anno game however and I felt like it was a great way to get introduced to this franchise because I can't wait to play the next game.**

The graphics from Anno 2205 look good and feel right for the type of game it is. The gameplay is quite simple: your employees need x resource so you need to make (more) of it. This starts of with building a single rice farm but in the end for a single resource you are going to need multiple locations with multiple production chains to satisfy this single resource need. That needs nicely into the different locations: there are 3 main locations in Anno 2205, each of which feels distinct and have different needs and productions. The endgame was a bit boring though since you are just waiting until you can upgrade enough houses to get a high enough level of employee.

The audio in the game is good, can't say I would listen to it outside of the game but I did not feel the need to turn it off in my 18 hours of playtime. I played using Geforce Now and it ran quite good on there so I don't think you'll need a supercomputer to run this game. The difficulty is actually quite nice, I only had one time that I felt stuck because I ran out of money on the moon but that was solved after some tips from Google.

During the campaign you get a story and it's not that great but I guess it helps give you a reason to start building bigger and bigger production chains. I spend 18 hours completing the campaign, but of course you could take it much further and there is even some DLC bits I didn't touch at all. There were no bugs encountered during my playtime.

The game is 12,50â‚¬ on sale right now and seeing how replayable it is I can definitely recommend it for that price (all DLC are included).
