This is my first post on my new blog! On this blog I will post all sorts of things that come to my mind: from a tutorial for some problem I've come across to a technology review.

But first, let me tell something about myself. My name is Rowan Paul Flyn and I'm a IT student at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem. In my free time I like to code things, game, watch tv, movies and chat with my friends on discord.

I hope you'll stick around and check out some of my other blog posts, they should be coming soon!
