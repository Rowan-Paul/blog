**Each year CGP Grey and Mike Hurley choose a yearly theme on the [Cortex podcast](https://www.relay.fm/cortex). This year I've decided to join them, since I finally have a good theme in mind for this year.**

Let's get one thing clear: what is a yearly theme? Well it's quite simple:

> The idea of Yearly Themes is something that CGP Grey and Myke Hurley have been living by for a number of years. Instead of resolutions, we set an overall idea of how we would like to approach each year or season. This becomes almost like a guiding principle for our work and/or personal lives for that period.

If you wanna know more about yearly themes, check the [theme system journal site](https://www.thethemesystem.com/).

Not being big on sporting, I haven't had something I'd want to call my yearly theme. But today I thought about something I've been thinking a lot about these past few years: how I spent my time. When I have vacation I always do 3 things:

1. watch TV shows/movies/YouTube
2. play games
3. sleep a lot
4. work on side projects

All of those are pretty valid things to do during vacation, because that's what that is for. But I always get the feeling when I've done one of those things that I "wasted" my time doing that while I should've been doing one of the other things. Finding a balance is quite hard for me, even though it doesn't actually matter at all (except for my brain).

That's why this year is going to be the year of focus: a year to stop with worrying about wasting my time doing any one of those things. Basically, if I'm going to be gaming all day I'm not gonna be upset I didn't finish my Lord of the Rings marathon. I'll probably keep you guys up-to-date here how it is going.

And another little tidbit: I've started doing push-ups 4 weeks ago and I'm on 60 already!
