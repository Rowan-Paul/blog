**On the 27th of September I decided I had once again had enough of my wired headphones breaking every month or so. My solution: buy a set of wireless headphones. In the end I choose the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z, a pair of wireless wired in-ear headphones. Especially the advertised 10 minutes charging for 10 hours of audio convinced me.**

The headphones are quite light, only weighing 28 grams in total (according to the specification from OnePlus). When I had them on I would barely notice them and they blended in quite nice. I would usually use them 8 to 10 hours a day, sometimes even more and never had any problems with their fitting or weight.

The only thing I would be bothered by is the inexplicable blinking light on the controls when the headphones are connected. This became quite the thing when I was walking around at night and it would just keep blinking every few seconds.

Now onto the battery, the main reason I bought these headphones. It's amazing. Really, it really is amazing. They charge by USB-C (love it!) and when I used my phone charger I would only need to charge in the morning for like 10 minutes each day of video lessons. That does bring me to another issue: there is no brick inside the package, only a small charging cable. This can be a bit annoying when you don't have a fast charger yourself. More on the charger situation later.

The sound is good, I'm not really someone who can talk about but voices were clear, music sounded right and gaming also sounded as expected. On the left side there are some controls embedded into the cable and they are quite frankly bad. I actually almost didn't use them because they don't give any useful feedback and therefor are not easy to handle. The quick switch on the other hand is something I used daily to switch between my phone and laptop. When you're not listening to the headphones the two buds attach magnetically to shut the headphones down.

Now onto the end of my amazing time with these headphones.

After a few weeks my right earbud didn't have the same volume as the left earbud. This is usually a sign the cable is broken on wired headphones, but seeing as these only have a neck cord I found it quite weird. After resetting it a few times the earbud went back to normal volume and I continued using them. This happened aroundn 3 times until the final time where it hasn't come back from yet.

My guess as to what was happening is that somehow me charging it with the phone charger shortend something or overheated something inside the earbuds. I haven't been able to find anything about other people experiencing this, so it's probably not a widespread problem. The phone charger charged with 9watts and the headphones were supposed to handle much higher speeds, so I don't know if it's really the explanation but it's the only one I can think of. I didn't wanna not have headphones for a few days so I decided to buy some new headphones, this time from Samsung.

Concluding, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z are great for the price (50â‚¬ when I bought them) and if you are looking for a great value pair of wireless headphones with a head cord. Do make sure to actually buy a compatible OnePlus brick chargers however.
