# blog-source
These are the source file for [my personal blog](https://blog.rowanpaulflynn.com) build with [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a free and open-source framework to build static React websites.

The website is build using the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) boilerplate template with a few modifications from me. After build it is commited to the gh-pages branch
 and deployed automatically by GitHub Pages.

If you want to run a local copy, clone this repo and run ``npm-install`` followed by ``gatsby develop``. You should now see the site at http://localhost:8000/.
