A great story and okay gameplay keep you on your toes because you never know what you will discover around the next corner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics, especially the ray-tracing look really great on Geforce Now and don’t seem to impact the FPS too much, staying always above 30 FPS (that I’ve noticed). Beautiful graphics. The gameplay on the other hand is a bit less, especially it not having explicit difficulty modes but several sliders to change yourself. Now technically this might be much better since the user can experiment themselves what feels right. I didn’t want to check what what slider did, so it would’ve been great if they just had a few templates that you can use without having to change all the different sliders and such. Rest of the gameplay kinda fun but without going into spoilers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The music is okay, I can’t really remember the soundtrack except the two times that a song is explicitly used in the plot. Coming back to the gameplay, the difficulty was okay, I felt like when I died that was because I sucked not because the game was too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control is set in a single office building, but it feels more than big enough for the entirety of the game. The story itself is I must say not what I expected, though I hadn’t seen anytihng about it except the title (and that it was good). It took me close to 12 hours to finish the main story with plently of side quests left undone, so the price might be a bit high if you only play once through the main story. I did not encounter a single bug (that I can remember) during my time with Control, which was pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallout New Vegas Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[Fallout: New Vegas might be a old at this point, but it’s story and gameplay are still fun in 2021.

For this review I followed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaFN2nAkGh0&amp;#x26;list=PLyh1OWxYFlNKqxYm42dPi9Q9YsYU6edLg&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on how to mod New Vegas. If you like RPGs and don’t mind walking around, give New Vegas a go.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics of New Vegas have definitely aged, but are still pretty good. Especially the world around you still looks pretty good, being helped by the fact that I could play maxed out settings of course. I haven’t seen everyting because I mostly sticked to the main story for my first playthrough (which took 23 hours) but most of the gameplay is the classic find a settlement, help the people (or murder them), get rich and onto the next town. The VATs is an interesting idea, but I didn’t really use it that often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soundtrack is kind of hidden, there are different radio stations that you can enable on your pip boy but the game doesn’t tell you this. Once you do find the radio stations, you probably wanna keep them on since they’re great and really fit the world well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to run the game on my potato pretty well and that’s no surprise seeing the age of the game, so you too should be fine. The difficulty isn’t all that high once you get a hold of the different weapons and when to use them. One point that you should always keep stocked are stimpacks since you can go into a mission and keep dying because of low health (making it really difficult unless you roll back and get some before starting the mission again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main story is a choose your own faction (or make your own) and it’s pretty cool how settlements react to you helping them or not, making it a ralistic world. Main story was pretty good though although at times it does fall into that do this thing for x so you can do this thing for y. The world is massive and they’re enough side quests at all times that I imagine you’d always have something to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As said in the intro, I had to install some mods that made it run better on a modern computer and fixed a whole lot of bugs. The base game itself would get a D on the bugs but with the fixes from the community I think it only caused me 1 BSOD in my playthrough (which is one too many of course). Looking at the mods available, New Vegas is definitely worth the price since you can turn it into so many different things though the base game (with some fixes) is also really great.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to setup nginx and pm2 for React & node]]></title><description><![CDATA[This tutorial assumes you already have a working Ubuntu VPS with the repositories downloaded to it, specifically in the var/www folder.

Also that you have your server setup to serve your React app, have setup your mongodb. I might make another tutorial for getting your repository on your VPS with SSH and GitHub Actions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this tutorial you will learn how to deploy a React app which is being served by a node.js backend server connected to a mongodb database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First we’re going to install node, npm, nginx and nano. The second &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm -v&lt;/code&gt; command lets you check the npm version (and checking if it installed at all).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_15.x -o nodesource_setup.sh
sudo bash nodesource_setup.sh
sudo apt install nodejs
nodejs -v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo apt install npm
npm -v
sudo apt-get install nginx
sudo apt install nano&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing these programs you can now install PM2, a process manager that will keep our server running 24/7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npm install -g pm2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we setup nginx, which will point your server to the server PM2 runs. Replace domain(.com) with your domain and pay attention to the port that you host your server on. We then simply do a validation check on the file and restart nginx to let the changes take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
nano default

# copy paste this into default
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default         upgrade;
    &amp;#39;&amp;#39;              close;
}
server {

       server_name domain.com www.domain.com;

       location / {
        # Backend nodejs server
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version  1.1;
        proxy_set_header    Upgrade     $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header    Connection  $connection_upgrade;
    }
}

# test if the configuration is correct
nginx -t

# restart nginx
systemctl restart nginx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we can install the HTTPS certificates so that your site gets that (green) lock icon (you should do this even if you don’t have any user input).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install --classic certbot
cd /
certbot --nginx -d domain.com -d www.domain.com
systemctl restart nginx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, you can start the PM2 by navigating to your server folder and starting the server which has a app.js file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cd var/www/backend
pm2 start app.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[On the 27th of September I decided I had once again had enough of my wired headphones breaking every month or so.

My solution: buy a set of wireless headphones. In the end I choose the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z, a pair of wireless wired in-ear headphones. Especially the advertised 10 minutes charging for 10 hours of audio convinced me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The headphones are quite light, only weighing 28 grams in total (according to the specification from OnePlus). When I had them on I would barely notice them and they blended in quite nice. I would usually use them 8 to 10 hours a day, sometimes even more and never had any problems with their fitting or weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing I would be bothered by is the inexplicable blinking light on the controls when the headphones are connected. This became quite the thing when I was walking around at night and it would just keep blinking every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto the battery, the main reason I bought these headphones. It’s amazing. Really, it really is amazing. They charge by USB-C (love it!) and when I used my phone charger I would only need to charge in the morning for like 10 minutes each day of video lessons. That does bring me to another issue: there is no brick inside the package, only a small charging cable. This can be a bit annoying when you don’t have a fast charger yourself. More on the charger situation later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sound is good, I’m not really someone who can talk about but voices were clear, music sounded right and gaming also sounded as expected. On the left side there are some controls embedded into the cable and they are quite frankly bad. I actually almost didn’t use them because they don’t give any useful feedback and therefor are not easy to handle. The quick switch on the other hand is something I used daily to switch between my phone and laptop. When you’re not listening to the headphones the two buds attach magnetically to shut the headphones down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now onto the end of my amazing time with these headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks my right earbud didn’t have the same volume as the left earbud. This is usually a sign the cable is broken on wired headphones, but seeing as these only have a neck cord I found it quite weird. After resetting it a few times the earbud went back to normal volume and I continued using them. This happened aroundn 3 times until the final time where it hasn’t come back from yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess as to what was happening is that somehow me charging it with the phone charger shortend something or overheated something inside the earbuds. I haven’t been able to find anything about other people experiencing this, so it’s probably not a widespread problem. The phone charger charged with 9watts and the headphones were supposed to handle much higher speeds, so I don’t know if it’s really the explanation but it’s the only one I can think of. I didn’t wanna not have headphones for a few days so I decided to buy some new headphones, this time from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z are great for the price (50€ when I bought them) and if you are looking for a great value pair of wireless headphones with a head cord. Do make sure to actually buy a compatible OnePlus brick chargers however.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Witcher 2 Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[This game shows how CDPR got from the Witcher 1 to the massive behemoth that is The Witcher 3.

The game is the shortest in the triology, but that is partly because of the big feature in the game: after the first act or so the story splits in two and you need to choose a side. Much beter than the first game, but still has some much needed polish missing. I finished the game on March 6th but only now got around to reviewing it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphics are good, they holds up pretty well. You can tell graphics were a priority for CDPR as all games in the series look pretty good even after all this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gameplay has become good, showing the first itteration of The Witcher 3 systems. Audio is also good I’d say, I don’t remember any songs but I never switched to listening to my own music during the duration of the game (the game is also pretty short so that helps of course). The audience firmly remains adults. The game needs a decent PC to run and performed good on Nvidia Geforce Now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all Witcher games, the game has some really difficult bosses that need specific techniques to beat them. As soon as you have Googled these techniques, the fight becomes easier. The grind isn’t really there as I focused on the main quest and was pretty on-level for most fights during the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is a bit weaker with the main antogonist ending up {spoiler}, but it’s still a lovely story that shows a real-feeling world that makes me excited to replay The Witcher 3. As said in the intro, I took 20 hours to complete the main game with a few side quests sprinkled in, so the game time is about average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together with the other Witcher games this game is definitly worth the price, though I’d advice playing The Witcher 3 to see if these games are anything for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bugs can get a bit annoying over time, but nothing really game breaking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Witcher 3 Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[This game is the best game I’ve played since Cyberpunk.

Both are amazing singleplayer story games with so many choices and outcomes. I absolutely love this game. This is my second playthrough so I played through every quest I got in my quest screen, which took me around 141 hours in total (including the 2 DLC).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently The Witcher 3 is being remastered into 4K with Raytracing, but the game already makes you forget what reality is. While traveling on Roach (they finally included her) just look around and be amazed at the beautiful scenery. That leads nicely into the very good gameplay. You have 2 main ways to get around: quick travel points that you have to discover sprinkled throughout the world and manually walking/riding/boating/swimming around. While quick traveling points are pretty good if you don’t have the patience to ride, using Roach to travel is the best way to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get quests by picking them up from notice boards, getting them through the main story or by walking into them. Pay attention to NPCs screaming at you with a exclamation point next to their name, these have quest for you. Yes, I did finish the whole GWENT part of the game, just as the fistfighting (which isn’t such a great system) and the horse races in each area of the game (both of which are pretty easy to win once you get how to play them). If you don’t know, GWENT is a kind of card game inside the Witcher universe which requires you to collect cards by playing NPCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The audio is very good, I can still hear the GWENT theme inside my head playing. During the game I did switch to listening to my own music, but that was more because of the length of the game and I always returned quickly to the game music. The game has pretty explicit scenes and a lot of violence, so naturally the game is for adults only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to run the game at high (which I would recommend since it looks great), you need a pretty fast pc. For my first playthrough I played on my own potato pc and it was playable on low, although my pc did get pretty hot. My second playthrough I did on Nvidia Geforce Now on high and it handled it pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like the previous two games, this game has some pretty difficult boss fights by design that need specific techniques to beat them. And just like the previous games it gets easier once you get an idea of the different counter moves you have to do in order to beat this specific boss. The grind is just like the other games, you can do all the sidequest and have a much easier time or just play through the main quest and be a bit underleveld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the story is absolutely amazing, for both the main game, the two DLCs and the other quests. I won’t spoil anything here, but please play Blood and Wine if you enjoyed the main game since it has a really nice ending to Geralt’s story (I haven’t even spoken about Geraly, but hey these are short reviews!). After finishing the game I want to read the books and replay the other games again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is easily more than a hundred hours long, during my first playthrough doing a few sidequests and no DLCs I finished in 43 hours. Having done a close-to-100%-playthrough this time, I finished after 141 hours. With this amount of content, the game is basically free for the on-sale price. That’s why I recommend you buy and play The Witcher 3 first so you know if these games are for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some minor bugs, for example Roach sometimes walks up against an invisible wall and can’t move past that point. This seems to be a problem with bridges or something, but it only happens every so often (just unmount and walk to the other side and call ROach).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These games are so massive, if you need a longer, super in depth review of The Witcher games I recommend the Witcher reviews from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyhnYIvIKK_--PiJXCMKxQQ&quot;&gt;Joseph Anderson&lt;/a&gt; (no Witcher 3, but it’s coming soon).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Witcher Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[While at the beginning I felt it was really dated, as the story progressed I started forgetting how old it was!

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Significant brain usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Easy to learn / Hard to master&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Dark Souls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even on easy mode there are quite a few hard (moster) fights for which you should really prepare potions and such (which I didn’t and got stuck)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Grind&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Nothing to grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Isn’t necessary to progress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Average grind level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Too much grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You‘ll need a second live for grinding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t do any sidequests, so I was underleved during the boss fights which really halted progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Story&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; No Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Some lore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Lovely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; It‘ll replace your life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;IIt’s The Witcher universe, it has lots of lore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Game Time&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Long&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; To infinity and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; It’s free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; Worth the price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; If u have some spare money left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Not recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You could also just burn your money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Together with the other Witcher games in a bundle, def worth it during sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Bugs&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Never heard of&lt;/li&gt;

Trying your best to manage your colonists, animals while also trying to achieve your own goals can get a little bit chaotic. This is just a great game to sit back and relax while trying to stop one of your colonists sets everything on fire.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This year I’ve decided to join them, since I finally have a good theme in mind for this year.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get one thing clear: what is a yearly theme? Well it’s quite simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of Yearly Themes is something that CGP Grey and Myke Hurley have been living by for a number of years. Instead of resolutions, we set an overall idea of how we would like to approach each year or season. This becomes almost like a guiding principle for our work and/or personal lives for that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wanna know more about yearly themes, check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thethemesystem.com/&quot;&gt;theme system journal site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being big on sporting, I haven’t had something I’d want to call my yearly theme. But today I thought about something I’ve been thinking a lot about these past few years: how I spent my time. When I have vacation I always do 3 things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;watch TV shows/movies/YouTube&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;play games&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sleep a lot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;work on side projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those are pretty valid things to do during vacation, because that’s what that is for. But I always get the feeling when I’ve done one of those things that I “wasted” my time doing that while I should’ve been doing one of the other things. Finding a balance is quite hard for me, even though it doesn’t actually matter at all (except for my brain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why this year is going to be the year of focus: a year to stop with worrying about wasting my time doing any one of those things. Basically, if I’m going to be gaming all day I’m not gonna be upset I didn’t finish my Lord of the Rings marathon. I’ll probably keep you guys up-to-date here how it is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And another little tidbit: I’ve started doing push-ups 4 weeks ago and I’m on 60 already!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having finished two playthroughs of this using Nvidia Geforce Now to play.

I’ve had a great time playing and still not done with it. The stories are just amazing and suck you in. Bugs are there, but mostly just visual. Recommended, can’t wait what else they do with this game and Judy is the best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;You forget what reality is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Beautiful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Decent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Don‘t look too long at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; MS-DOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This game looks amazing, even without Ray Tracing. Truly next-gen (see: all the screenshots I took)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Very good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It‘s just gameplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Mehh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Watch paint dry instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Just don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Driving kinda broke, use a motorcycle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eargasm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Very good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Not too bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; I’m now deaf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soundtrack is great, always have the radio on while driving&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Decent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Fast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Rich boi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ask NASA if they have a spare computer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Using Nvidia Geforce Now, I get around 40-60 fps on Ultra, raytracing takes about another 10 off of there&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Difficulity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Just press ‘W’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Easy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Significant brain usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Easy to learn / Hard to master&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Difficult&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Dark Souls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Grind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Nothing to grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Isn’t necessary to progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Average grind level&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Too much grind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You‘ll need a second live for grinding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Story&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; No Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Some lore&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Lovely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;It‘ll replace your life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Main story pretty good, sidequests are even better&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Long enough for a cup of coffee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Average&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Long&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; To infinity and beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;First playthrough took me 38 hours, second took me 36&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; It’s free!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Worth the price&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; If u have some spare money left&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Not recommended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You could also just burn your money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bugs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Never heard of&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Minor bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Can get annoying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game has bugs, but most are just visual glitches. Also driving kinda sucks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Planet Zoo Review]]></title><description><![CDATA[Very much a continuation of Planet Coaster, which I liked quite a bit.

Been playing the Career parks and having a blast so far. Animals look pretty good, but still has quite some time before it reaches that Zoo Tycoon 2 level&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You forget what reality is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Beautiful&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Decent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Don‘t look too long at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; MS-DOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Gameplay&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Very good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Mehh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Watch paint dry instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Just don’t&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Not too bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; I’m now deaf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animals sound very real, soundtrack is fitting but i’ve already put on some of my own music instead of it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Career missions have voice over and some story&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Game Time&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; checked disabled&gt; &lt;strong&gt;To infinity and beyond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It took me 10 houors to complete the first 4 career missions, but of course there’s freeplay which makes it quite infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Price&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; It’s free!&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li class=&quot;task-list-item&quot;&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; disabled&gt; You could also just burn your money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without the DLC, it’s 22€ right now, definitly worth it to me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In short: cool that you’ve got no ads, but the extra features seem unpolished and not thought out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s get some things straight: I’ve watched a lot of YouTube, but the last year I’ve been more into gaming. Thus my watching habit is usually between 1 and two hours a day (on average). I’ve taken the free YouTube Premium trial for two months that I got because I have a Samsung Galaxy A50. I canceled halfway through the trial and still got the entire free two week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t think anyone really likes ads, especially when you’re trying to relax after a long day of work. Because of the current global pandemic, YouTube ads have also kind of gotten worse. Most big companies have cut budget on ads, thus allowing smaller ads to get a bigger audience. Anyway I got fed up with the weird ads that made no sense and finally got YouTube Premium.&lt;/p&gt;

        loading=&quot;lazy&quot;
      /&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I haven’t had a YouTube in ad in a while (except those build-in to the videos themself) and I must say it’s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big feature is the option to automatically play videos in a pop-up player when switching to another app. I used to use multitasking in Android, but just having a pop-up player is quite nice for chatting and watching a video. The thing is that the pop-up player doesn’t always listen to your commands and sometimes just freaks out. Not ideal if your putting it as a premium feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I haven’t really tried is background play. On like the first video YouTube will ask you if you want to enable background play, meaning that if you lock your phone the video audio keeps playing. I didn’t like that, so I turned that off But when I wanted to try it out later, I was unable to turn it on. YouTube supports suggests to check under settings, but I can’t find anything related to backgrounnd play. A button on the video woud’ve been a nice addition anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So YouTube Premium, would I recommend? Not if you want to use it for the extra features because those are just not worth paying for. But as a paid ad-blocker for YouTube, perhaps if you don’t like the gray area where apps like &lt;a href=&quot;https://newpipe.net/&quot;&gt;NewPipe&lt;/a&gt; live in. In the end, I’m not gonna resubscribe and just let the trial run out when it does.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows Bluetooth Audio]]></title><description><![CDATA[Last week I got new bluetooth headphones, the Oneplus Bullets Wireless Z to be exact.

I really like them, but when using them on Windows they sometimes freak out and stop playing sound altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really happens is that they start playing sound on the “hands-free” version of the device when a game accessess the microphone (note that it doesn’t &lt;em&gt;use&lt;/em&gt; it). This happens especially often in games because they often use get your audio input configured when loading the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thing with the hands-free version is that it plays audio with a lower quality to decrease latency or something making it sound like I was listening to my game trough an old timey phone call. Not ideal to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution seemed simple enough: just force the program to use the normal version of the device through Windows audio settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was quite easy to do except… it didn’t seem to do anything! It would still play over the hands free version no matter what I did. I tried disabling the device, using some output switcher program and all sorts of other things I found in my Google searches, but nothing helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until I disabled microphone access trough Windows while also disabling the hands-free version of the device. This worked, but felt a like a bad solution because it would simply mean I couldn’t use a microphone and these headsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A day later I found an obscure post somewhere talking about communications devices and how they are different than microphones in Windows settings. This, it turned out, was my golden ticket. I went into Sound Control Panel, right-clicked my laptop microphone and clicked “Set as default communication device”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked! I’m now happily doing everything on my phone and laptop using my bluetooth headphones. I thought I’d share this with you since the internet didn’t have a clear answer to my question.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello World]]></title><description><![CDATA[This is my first post on my new blog!

On this blog I will post all sorts of things that come to my mind: from a tutorial for some problem I’ve come across to a technology review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let me tell something about myself. My name is Rowan Paul Flyn and I’m a IT student at the HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem. In my free time I like to code things, game, watch tv, movies and chat with my friends on discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ll stick around and check out some of my other blog posts, they should be coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
